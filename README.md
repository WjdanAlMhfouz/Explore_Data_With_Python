# Explore data with python

In this project, I used Python to examine data on bike-sharing systems in three u.s. Cities: Chicago, New York City, and Washington. I wrote code to import the data and generate descriptive statistics to answer an important question about it. Create an interactive experience in the terminal to represent these data by writing a script that takes in raw input.

### Tools Used:

- Python 3, NumPy, and pandas installed using Anaconda
- PyCharm IDEs

#### DATASET ARE AVAILABLE AT THE MASTER BRUNCH
